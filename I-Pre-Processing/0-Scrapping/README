# CRON

For better scrapping and downloading with a limiting rate (in order to
avoid an overuse/refusal from BnF Gallica), add the following Cron job :

*/2 * * * * /.../get_text.sh & sleep 24 ; /.../get_text.sh & sleep 24 ; /.../get_text.sh & sleep 24 ; ./get_text.sh & sleep 24 ; /.../get_text.sh

# DATABASE

To select which documents will be taken from BnF Gallica, add the following infos in all_text.py (for as many document groups as desired) :

Name
https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/DOCUMENT/date
Start Year
Start Month
Start Day
End Year
End Month
End Day
Time between two documents
Time unit (j for day, m for month)
